# Open MCT Scripting Tool

Last updated: 12 Apr 2024

Allows large scale creation of a variety of Open MCT views, many with integrated Conditional styling. Source files include tabular CSV, PRIDE .prl files, and Python ground control scripts (GCS). The tool outputs JSON files that are imported into Open MCT.

1. Create and/or gather input files.
2. Run those inputs through this tool, which then outputs an Open MCT import-ready JSON file.
3. Import that JSON file into Open MCT in the environment and location desired.

The tool also provides a capability to extract telemetry paths from GCS scripts and PRIDE PRL files into a CSV output.
